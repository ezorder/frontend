What is it?

EZorder is an application that allows customers to easily order food in large scale, fast paced restaurant or eatery. The application is currently powered on a web application that utilizes 3 devices including the order, the server, and the chef. 


The order is placed and a request is sent out to both the kitchen and the chef at the same time. The chef will then indicate when he is completed with the order, and then alerts the server that is is ready. The server then brings the meal to the customer. This application will increase efficiency and has the potential to be used in large scale monitoring with analytics.

This application uses node.js, angular.js, bootstrap, and mongoDB for the database.
